# WittneyBolden_FRBP

This is the Software Development Assignment for a position at the FRBP, written by Wittney Bolden

This solution includes a WebAPI project and an MVC application both using C# 7 and .NET Framework 4.5.

Additional resources include: Bootstrap 5.0.2, Chart.js 3.4.1, among other things.

Note:
Ordinarilly, I would include Logging and the Unit Tests and documentation but, I'm out of hard drive space and I would need to update my development environment.
